# Restaurant-Tracker


* Purpose of the App: The purpose of this app is to be able to keep track of restaurants you have went to, as well as recording certain information about that restaurant.  By creating a list that a user can reference at any time, one will be able to track all their favorite places to eat with a click of a button!


* Features on the App: 
After creating a unique user profile, one will have the option to add a restaurant to their list or view their list of previous restaurants that were recorded.  Along with adding a restaurant to the list, a user will be able to associate reviews/comments to the specific restaurant they want. Restaurants as well as reviews can be added or deleted at any point dependent on the users intended purpose of the app.
